**Advanced Recommendation Engine: Enhancing E-Commerce Recommendations with Database Optimization and Collaborative Filtering**

This project presents a comprehensive approach to designing and implementing a recommendation system tailored for e-commerce platforms. The system combines diverse recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering, K-Nearest neighbors (KNN) with means, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Alternating Least Squares (ALS), to provide personalized product recommendations to users. The architecture prioritizes high availability and low latency, ensuring real-time responses to user interactions while acknowledging the trade-offs between consistency and availability. The project leverages a robust tech stack, encompassing data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn, data processing with pandas and scipy.stats (z-score), big data processing through PySpark and SparkContext, and additional tools like ydata-profiling and scikit-learn. The MySQL database, along with UI frameworks such as Streamlit, Flask, and Tornado, plays a vital role in handling data and user interactions efficiently.
This project also integrates the original table with unstructured data like review comments data for the purchase transaction. Performing these algorithms are computationally heavy and including comment data, adds an additional layer of complexity, but these offer more realistic trends of the actual purchase. This offers valuable insights into algorithm selection, system design, and real-time processing trade-offs, advancing recommendation systems in the dynamic landscape of online retail. It serves as a practical guide for organizations seeking to enhance user experiences and drive business growth through intelligent recommendation systems.
